# Quake (Sega Saturn) For PC

What better way to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the founding of Lobotomy Software than by focusing on their miraculous, unlikely, and incredible Sega Saturn port of Quake.

The goal of this project is to make this version of the game playable on PC, by porting the assets (levels, models, sprites, etc) into a modern Quake engine sourceport. The current focus of the project is a Blender plugin that allows the import and processing of the level data files from the game.

# FAQ

### Q: How do I load a level?

A: When greeted with the console, type map (mapname).iqm - the extension is important! You'll have to noclip (v key) to get around, since the spawnpoints aren't properly placed yet. There's also no textures. Everything is super early.
